## EC2 Tenancy - Shared vs Dedicated

![](/images/aws/ec2-host.png)

When ever we create EC2 instances, we are using **Shared Tenancy** by default. In Shared tenancy, single host machine can have instances from multiple customers.

There are two Dedicated EC2 options:
- EC2 Dedicated Instances
- EC2 Dedicated Hosts

**EC2 Dedicated Instances** are Virtualized instances on hardware dedicated to one customer:
- You do NOT have visibility into the hardware of underlying host

**EC2 Dedicated Hosts** are Physical servers dedicated to one customer:
- You have visibility into the hardware of underlying host (sockets and physical cores)
- (Use cases) Regulatory needs or server-bound software licenses like Windows Server, SQL Server

## EC2 Dedicated Instances vs Hosts
