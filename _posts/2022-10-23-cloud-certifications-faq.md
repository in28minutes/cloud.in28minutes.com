## 1: Which cloud should I learn?

This question comes in different forms. But, the essence of the question is typically the same: Which cloud will be the most popular one in 5 years or 10 years time?

I wish I had a golden ball!

Technology predictions are difficult to make and I'm not going to burn my hands making one now.

The answer is: No one knows which of the cloud platforms will be the most popular one in 5 years or 10 years.

But there is something I'm almost certain about: If you are in top 1 percentile for skills on any of three popular cloud platforms - AWS or Azure or Google Cloud - there will be a huge demand for your skills - now, in 2 years and in 5 years.

It does not matter which cloud platform you pick. Become an expert at it!

## 2: How can a beginner learn the cloud?

Each cloud platform has more than 200+ services.

How does a beginner to cloud platform know where to start?

Even to decide a career path to choose, you need to have a basic understanding of the cloud platform.

That's where the beginner cloud certifications have a great role to play!

If you are a beginner to cloud with no cloud experience, these certifications are a great place to start
- Google Cloud Digital Leader Certification
- Azure Fundamental AZ-900 Certification
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification

Preparing for these certifications help you understand:
- Cloud Fundamentals - What? , Why?, IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS, ..
- An overview of different types of services offered by the cloud platforms
- Understand technology evolution: Serverless, Containers, Container Orchestration, DevOps, Big Data, Data Lakes, Data warehouses, Machine Learning, ..

## 3: Should every one pursue beginner certifications?

Beginner certifications are great for beginners. But, for experienced cloud professionals, they are (mostly) a waste of time!

If you have spent more than an year working with a cloud platform, skip beginner level certifications. Directly jump into role specific certifications - Developer, Architect, Data Engineer, ML, Security, Networking. Pick a certification based on your role. Shoot for it.

> REMEMBER: Cloud certifications are NOT a Shortcut to a new role. You will NOT get an Architects role by just doing an Architect certification. You need to have the experience of an Architect as well. (Lesson: There is no value in doing Architect certifications if you are just getting started with technology)

## 4: Will a cloud certification get me a Job?


Cloud certifications are a step in the learning process. 

To get a job: 
- Get a certification
- Go hands-on
- Build a profile of projects
- Build a great GitHub profile

Certifications are great on your resume. But, remember, they are just an icing on top of the actual cake - which is your skills.

Here is a result from a survey I've done on cloud certifications a little while back:

## 5: What is your most important tip for planning a career in the cloud?

Get a mentor. 

Remember - your course instructor is NOT a mentor. 

A mentor is somebody who understands YOU and understands the technology you want to master.

## 6: When should I go Multi Cloud?

Switching between cloud too often can result in a lot of confusion, especially if you are new to the cloud.

Give a cloud platform a year or two. And then go multi cloud.

PS: Multi cloud is inevitable. In my view, in a few years, you might playing with multiple cloud platforms during the same work day. But, don't go there too soon.

> RECOMMENDATION: Have a couple of years of experience with your first cloud before you venture into your second one

## 7: Should I be good at programming to learn the cloud?

Not necessary.

Programming is awesome skill for Developer, Design, Architect and Engineering roles.

However, there are several other roles available in the cloud. Not all roles need programming skills.

## 8: Should I learn Cloud or DevOps first?

DevOps focuses on improving communication, enabling quick feedback and ensuring greater automation in the various steps of software development process.

You can do DevOps in your data center as well as in the cloud.

However, cloud makes automation easy. For example: Infrastructure as code is very easy to do in the cloud. Setting up CI/CD is typically easier to do in the cloud than in an data center.

DevOps is a mindset more than a tool or a process. But, its easier to get into a DevOps mindset when automation is easier.

That's the reason why I recommend learning DevOps in the cloud.
