## Amazon S3 Storage Classes - Introduction

**Different kinds of data** can be stored in Amazon S3
- Media files and archives
- Application packages and logs
- Backups of your databases or storage devices
- Long term archives

There are Huge variations in **access patterns**. So, you have to **Trade-off** between access time and cost.

**S3 storage classes** help to optimize your costs while meeting access time needs. They are designed for durability of **99.999999999%(11 9â€™s)**.

## Amazon S3 Storage Classes - Types

Here are the important S3 Storage Classes:

|Storage Class|Scenario|AZs|
|--|:--|:--|
|Standard|Frequently accessed data|>=3|
|Standard-IA|Long-lived, infrequently accessed data (backups for disaster recovery)|>=3|
|One Zone-IA|Long-lived, infrequently accessed, non-critical data (Easily re-creatable data - thumbnails for images)|1|
|Intelligent-Tiering|Long-lived data with changing or unknown access patterns|>=3|
|Glacier|Archive data with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours|>=3|
|Glacier Deep Archive|Archive data that rarely, if ever, needs to be accessed with retrieval times in hours|>=3|
|Reduced Redundancy (Not recommended)|Frequently accessed, non-critical data|>=3|
