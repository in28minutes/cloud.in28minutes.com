Let's get a quick overview of Virtual Machines in Google Cloud Platform from an GCP certification perspective. We will look at important certification questions regarding Virtual Machines in Google Cloud Platform.


## You will learn
- What is Virtual Machines (VM)?
- How VMs work?
- Why we use Virtual Machines?

## Virtual Machine

```sh
A VM is a virtualized instance of a computer that can perform almost all of the same functions as a computer, 
including running applications and operating systems.
```

In simple word, A VM is a digital version of a physical computer. 
It can perform following operations
- Run applications and OS
- Storing data
- Connecting to networks
- Other computing functions

Note : It requires maintenace like system monitoring and updates.
You can host multiple VMs in GCP.

## How Virtual Machines Work?

Virtual machines run on a physical machine and access computing resources from software called a hypervisor. The hypervisor abstracts the physical machine’s resources into a pool that can be provisioned and distributed as needed, enabling multiple VMs to run on a single physical machine.

## Why we use Virtual Machines?

For virtualization of computing resources, VMs are the basic building blocks. It provides environment, tools for creating any applications.

- You can set up VMs as servers that can host other VMs, which reduce stretch by centralizing more resources in a single physical machine.
- VM provide different environments for development and testing with full functionality without any impact on the surrounding infrastructure.
- You can easily turn off or on VMs, also easy to migrate and adapt, they provide maximum flexibility for development.
- VMs provide flexibility and portability that increase the velocity of migration capacity.
- Deploying systems in cloud environments using VMs provide extra layer of security and assurance.
