Let's get a quick overview of Auto Scaling Groups and Dynamic Scaling Policies from an AWS certification perspective. We will look at important certification questions regarding Auto Scaling Groups and Dynamic Scaling Policies.

## You will learn
- What is Auto Scaling Group in an Elastic Load Balancer?
- Why do we need Dynamic Scaling?
- What are the different Dynamic Scaling Policies available?
- What are the Certification and Interview Questions for Auto Scaling Groups and Dynamic Scaling Policies ?
- What role does CloudWatch play in Auto Scaling Groups and Dynamic Scaling Policies?



## Introducing ALB Auto Scaling Groups
Target Groups are configured with a static set of instances. How do you scale out and scale in **automatically**?
- Configure a Auto Scaling Group

## ALB Auto Scaling Groups
Here are some of the important Auto Scaling Group responsibilities:
- **Maintain** configured number of instances (using periodic health checks)
	- If an instance goes down, ASG launches replacement instance
- **Auto scale** to adjust to load (scale-in and scale-out based on auto scaling policies)

Important things to note:
- ASG can launch On-Demand Instances, Spot Instances, or both 
	- **Best Practice**: Use Launch Template
- An ELB can distribute load to **active instances** as ASG expands and contracts based on the load

## Auto Scaling Components

Important Auto Scaling Components include:
- **Launch Configuration/Template**
	- EC2 instance size and AMI
- **Auto Scaling Group**
	- Reference to Launch Configuration/Template
	- Min, max and desired size of ASG
	- EC2 health checks by default. Optionally enable ELB health checks.
	- **Auto Scaling Policies**
		- When and How to execute scaling?

## Auto Scaling Group - Use Cases

![](/images/aws/asg.png) 

| ASG Use case | Description  | More details | 
|--|--|--|
| Maintain current instance levels at all times   |  min = max = desired = CONSTANT<BR/> When an instance becomes unhealthy, it is replaced.     |   Constant load |
| Scale manually    |   Change desired capacity as needed   |  You need complete control over scaling  |
| Scale based on a schedule |  Schedule a date and time for scaling up and down. | Batch programs with regular schedules|
| Scale based on demand (Dynamic/Automatic Scaling) | Create scaling policy (what to monitor?) and scaling action (what action?) | Unpredictable load |

## Dynamic Scaling Policy Types

| Scaling Policy | Example(s)  | Description | 
|--|--|--|
| Target tracking scaling   |  Maintain CPU Utilization at 70%.|  Modify current capacity based on a target value for a specific metric.    |
|  Simple scaling   | +5 if CPU utilization > 80% <BR/> -3 if CPU utilization < 60%| Waits for cooldown period before triggering additional actions. | 
|  Step scaling   | +1 if CPU utilization between 70% and 80%<BR/> +3 if CPU utilization between 80% and 100%<BR/> Similar settings for scale down| Warm up time can be configured for each instance| 

## Scaling Policies - Background

- Two parts:
	- CloudWatch alarm (Is CPU utilization >80%? or < 60%). 
	- Scaling action (+5 EC2 instances or -3 EC2 instances)

## Quick Review

##### Concepts
- **Auto Scaling Group** - Maintain configured number of instances (using periodic health checks). Auto scale to adjust to load.
- **Dynamic Scaling Policies** - Target tracking scaling, Simple scaling and Step scaling.
- **CloudWatch alarms** track the metric (Is CPU utilization >80%? or < 60%) and trigger the auto scaling action (+5 EC2 instances or -3 EC2 instances)

## Auto Scaling - Certification and Interview Questions
| Scenario | Solution | 
|--|--|
|Change instance type or size of ASG instances|Launch configuration or Launch template cannot be edited. Create a new version and ensure that the ASG is using the new version. Terminate instances in small groups.|
|Roll out a new security patch (new AMI) to ASG instances| Same as above.|
| Perform actions before an instance is added or removed| Create a Lifecycle Hook. You can configure CloudWatch to trigger actions based on it. |
|Which instance in an ASG is terminated first when a scale-in happens?| (**Default Termination Policy**) Within constraints, goal is to distribute instances evenly across available AZs. Next priority is to terminate older instances.|
| Preventing frequent scale up and down | Adjust cooldown period to suit your need (default - 300 seconds). Align CloudWatch monitoring interval |
| I would want to protect newly launched instances from scale-in|Enable instance scale-in protection|
