Let's get a quick overview of Multi-AZ vs Multi-Region vs Read replicas for Amazon RDS from an AWS certification perspective.

## You will learn
- What are Multi-AZ Deployments?
- What are Read replicas?
- How do you choose between Multi-AZ deployments vs Multi-Region vs Same-Region Read replicas?

## Multi-AZ Deployments

- Standby created in a different AZ
- **Synchronous replication** (strong consistency)
- Enhances durability, availability and fault tolerance of your database
- Multi-AZ makes **maintenance easy**
	- Perform maintenance (patches) on standby
	- Promote standby to primary
	- Perform maintenance on (old) primary
- **Avoid I/O suspension** when data is backed up (snapshots are taken from standby)
- No downtime when database is converted to Multi AZ
	- Increased latency until standby is ready
- Not allowed to connect to standby database directly 
	- For example: Standby CANNOT be used to serve read traffic
	- Standby increases availability but does not improve scalability
- Automatic failover to standby if master has problems (compute, storage or networking)
	- CNAME record flipped to standby
	- Database performance issues (long running queries or deadlocks) will NOT cause a failover
- (Good Practice) Use DNS name of database in applications configuration

## Read Replicas

- Support **read-heavy database workloads** - reporting and data warehousing 
- Can be in same or different AZ or different Region
- Your apps can connect to them
- Create read replica(s) of a read replica
- Uses **asynchronous replication**
	- Provides eventual consistency (from replica)
	- For higher consistency, read from master
- Need to be **explicitly deleted** (Not deleted when database is deleted)
- (Mandatory) Enable automatic backups before you can create read replicas
	- Set Backup Retention period to a value other than 0
- Reduce replication lag by using better compute and storage resources
- Maximum no of read replicas:
	- MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle - 5
	- Aurora - 15
	- SQL Server does not support read replicas
