- What is IAAS(Infrastructure as a Service) ?
- What is PAAS (Platform as a Service) ?
- What are the different Managed Services provided by AWS?
- What is Shared Responsibility Model?

## IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service) 

IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service) is all about using **only infrastructure** from cloud provider. It is also called "**Lift and Shift**". **Example**: Using EC2 to deploy your applications or databases

With IAAS, you are responsible for:
- Application Code and Runtime
- Configuring load balancing
- Auto scaling
- OS upgrades and patches
- Availability
- etc.. ( and a lot of things!)

## PAAS (Platform as a Service) 

PAAS (Platform as a Service) is all about using a platform provided by cloud

**Cloud provider** is responsible for:
- OS (incl. upgrades and patches)
- Application Runtime
- Auto scaling, Availability & Load balancing etc..

**You** are responsible for:
- Application code
- Configuration

Examples of PAAS
- **CAAS (Container as a Service)**: Containers instead of Applications
- **FAAS (Function as a Service)** or **Serverless**: Functions instead of Applications

## AWS Managed Service Offerings

Here are some of the AWS Managed Service Offerings:
- **Elastic Load Balancing** - Distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** - Run and Manage Web Apps
- **Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)** - Containers orchestration on AWS
- **AWS Fargate** - Serverless compute for containers
- **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** - Run Kubernetes on AWS
- **Amazon RDS** - Relational Databases - MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server etc
- And a lot more...

## Shared Responsibility Model

Security & Compliance is shared responsibility between AWS and customer

## Shared Responsibility Model - Amazon EC2

Amazon EC2 instances is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

You are responsible for:
- Guest OS (incl. security patches)
- Application software installed
- Configuring Security Groups (or firewalls)

AWS is responsible for infrastructure layer only.

## Shared Responsibility Model - Managed Services

Amazon S3 & DynamoDB are managed services.

AWS manages infrastructure layer, OS, and platform.

You are responsible for
- Managing your data 
- Managing security of data at rest(encryption) 
- Managing security of data in transit 
	- Mandating SSL/HTTPS 
	- Using the right network - AWS global network or dedicated private network when possible
- Managing access to the service
	- Configure right permissions (IAM users/roles/user policies/resource policies)
	- (FOR AWS RDS) Managing in database users 
	- Configuring the right security groups (control inbound and outbound traffic)
	- Disabling external access (public vs private)
