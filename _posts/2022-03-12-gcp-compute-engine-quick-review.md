## Google Compute Engine Quick Review

- **Image:**
  - What **operating system and what software** do you want on the VM instance?
  - Reduce boot time and improve security by creating custom **hardened Images.**
  - You can share an Image with other projects  
- **Machine Types:**
  - Optimized combination of compute(CPU, GPU), memory, disk (storage) and networking for specific workloads.
  - You can **create your own Custom Machine Types** when existing ones don't fit your needs  
- **Static IP Addresses:** Get a constant IP addresses for VM instances
- **Instance Templates:** Pre-configured templates simplifying the creation of VM instances
- **Sustained use discounts: Automatic discounts** for running VM instances for significant portion of the billing month
- **Committed use discounts:** 1 year or 3 year **reservations** for workloads with **predictable resource** needs
- **Preemptible VM:** Short-lived cheaper (upto 80%) compute instances for non-time-critical fault-tolerant workloads
