Let's get a quick overview of how you can choose between different AWS Databases. How do you choose RDS vs DynamoDB vs Redshift?

## You will learn
- What are the different types of databases?
- How can you choose the right AWS database for your scenario?
- What are the differences between RDS vs DynamoDB vs Redshift?
- When do you use RDS vs DynamoDB vs Redshift?

- There are **several categories** of databases:
	- Relational (OLTP and OLAP), Document, Key Value, Graph, In Memory among others
- **Choosing type of database** for your use case is not easy. A few factors:
	- Do you want a **fixed schema**?
		- Do you want flexibility in defining and changing your schema? (schemaless)
	- What level of **transaction properties** do you need? (atomicity and consistency)
	- What kind of **latency** do you want? (seconds, milliseconds or microseconds)
	- **How many transactions** do you expect? (hundreds or thousands or millions of transactions per second)
	- **How much data** will be stored? (MBs or GBs or TBs or PBs)
	- and a lot more...

## Relational Databases

![Database](/images/aws/relational-schema.png)
- This was the **only option** until a decade back!
- Most **popular (or unpopular)** type of databases
- **Predefined schema** with tables and relationships
- Very **strong transactional** capabilities
- Used for 
	- OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) use cases and
	- OLAP (Online Analytics Processing) use cases

## Relational Database - OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)

![](/images/aws/00-icons/rds.png) 
- Applications where **large number of users make large number of small transactions** 
	- small data reads, updates and deletes
- **Use cases**:
	- Most traditional applications, ERP, CRM, e-commerce, banking applications
- **Popular databases**:
	- MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server etc
- Recommended AWS Managed Service: 
	- **Amazon RDS**
	- Supports Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB (Enhanced MySQL), Oracle Database, and SQL Server

## Relational Database - OLAP (Online Analytics Processing)

![](/images/aws/00-icons/redshift.png) 
- Applications allowing users to **analyze petabytes of data**
	- **Examples** : Reporting applications, Data ware houses, Business intelligence applications, Analytics systems
	- **Sample application** : Decide insurance premiums analyzing data from last hundred years
	- Data is consolidated from multiple (transactional) databases
- Recommended AWS Managed Service 
	- **Amazon Redshift**
	- **Petabyte-scale** distributed data ware house based on PostgreSQL

## Relational Databases - OLAP vs OLTP

![Database](/images/aws/database-columnar-storage-2.png)

- OLAP and OLTP use **similar data structures**
- BUT **very different approach in how data is stored**
- **OLTP databases** use row storage 
	- Each table row is stored together
	- Efficient for processing small transactions
- **OLAP databases** use columnar storage
	- Each table column is stored together
	- **High compression** - store petabytes of data efficiently
	- **Distribute data** - one table in multiple cluster nodes 
	- **Execute single query across multiple nodes** - Complex queries can be executed efficiently

## Document Database

![](/images/aws/database-document.png)
![](/images/aws/document-database-example.png)

- Structure data **the way your application needs it**
- Create **one table instead of dozens**!
- **Quickly evolving** semi structured data (**schema-less**)
- **Use cases** : Content management, catalogs, user profiles
- **Advantages** : (Horizontally) Scalable to **terabytes of data** with **millisecond responses** upto **millions of transactions per second**
- Recommended AWS Managed Service 
	- **Amazon DynamoDB**

## Key-value
![Database](/images/aws/database-key-value.png)
![Database](/images/aws/database-session-store.png)
- Use a **simple key-value pair** to store data. Key is a unique identifier.
- Values can be objects, compound objects or simple data values
- **Advantages** : (Horizontally) Scalable to **terabytes of data** with **millisecond responses** upto **millions of transactions per second**
- Recommended AWS Managed Service - **Amazon DynamoDB** again
- **Use cases** : shopping carts, session stores, gaming applications and very high traffic web apps

## Graph
![Database](/images/aws/graph.png)
- **Store and navigate** data with complex relationships
- **Use cases** : Social Networking Data (Twitter, Facebook), Fraud Detection
- Recommended AWS Managed Service - **Amazon Neptune**

## In-memory Databases

![](/images/aws/00-icons/elasticache.png) 
- **Retrieving data from memory is much faster from retrieving data from disk**
- In-memory databases like Redis deliver microsecond latency by storing **persistent data in memory**
- Recommended AWS Managed Service 
	- **Amazon ElastiCache**
	- Supports Redis and Memcached
		- Redis is recommended for persistent data
		- Memcached is recommended for simple caches
- **Use cases** : Caching, session management, gaming leader boards, geospatial applications

## AWS Databases - Summary

| Database Type | AWS Service  | Description |
