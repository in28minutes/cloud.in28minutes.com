# IAM

## Typical identity management in the cloud

![](./gcpimages/00-icons/gcp/iam.png)
- You have **resources** in the cloud (examples - a virtual server, a database etc)
- You have **identities (human and non-human)** that need to access those resources and perform actions 
	- For example: launch (stop, start or terminate) a virtual server
- How do you **identify users** in the cloud?
	- How do you configure resources they can access? 
	- How can you configure what actions to allow?
- In GCP: *Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM)* provides this service


## Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM)

![](./gcpimages/00-icons/gcp/iam.png)
- **Authentication** (is it the right user?) and 
- **Authorization** (do they have the right access?) 
- **Identities** can be 
	- A GCP User (Google Account or Externally Authenticated User)
	- A Group of GCP Users
	- An Application running in GCP
	- An Application running in your data center
	- Unauthenticated users
- Provides very **granular** control
	- Limit a single user:
		- to perform single action
		- on a specific cloud resource
		- from a specific IP address
		- during a specific time window

## Cloud IAM Example

![](./gcpimages/00-icons/gcp/user-card.png)
![](./gcpimages/arrowtd.png)
![](./gcpimages/00-icons/gcp/storage-card.png)
- I want to provide access to manage a specific cloud storage bucket to a colleague of mine:
	- Important Generic Concepts:
		- **Member**: My colleague
		- **Resource**: Specific cloud storage bucket
		- **Action**: Upload/Delete Objects
	- In Google Cloud IAM:
		- **Roles**: A set of permissions (to perform specific actions on specific resources)
			- **Roles do NOT know about members**. It is all about permissions!
		- How do you assign permissions to a member?
			- **Policy**: You assign (or **bind**) a role to a member
- 1: **Choose a Role** with right permissions (Ex: Storage Object Admin)
- 2: **Create Policy** binding member (your friend) with role (permissions)
- IAM in AWS is very different from GCP (Forget AWS IAM & Start FRESH!)
	- Example: Role in AWS is NOT the same as Role in GCP


## IAM - Roles

![](./gcpimages/00-icons/gcp/iam.png)
- **Roles are Permissions**:
	- Perform some set of actions on some set of resources
- Three Types:
	- **Basic Roles (or Primitive roles)** - Owner/Editor/Viewer
		- **Viewer(roles.viewer)** - Read-only actions
		- **Editor(roles.editor)** - Viewer + Edit actions 
		- **Owner(roles.owner)** - Editor + Manage Roles and Permissions + Billing
		- EARLIEST VERSION: Created before IAM
		- NOT RECOMMENDED: **Don't use in production**
	- **Predefined Roles** - Fine grained roles predefined and managed by Google
		- Different roles for different purposes
		- **Examples**: Storage Admin, Storage Object Admin, Storage Object Viewer, Storage Object Creator
	- **Custom Roles** - When predefined roles are NOT sufficient, you can create your own custom roles


## IAM - Predefined Roles - Example Permissions

![](./gcpimages/00-icons/gcp/iam.png)
- Important **Cloud Storage Roles**:
	- **Storage Admin (roles/storage.admin)**
		- storage.buckets.* 
		- storage.objects.*
	- **Storage Object Admin (roles/storage.objectAdmin)**
		- storage.objects.*
	- **Storage Object Creator (roles/storage.objectCreator)**
		- storage.objects.create
	- **Storage Object Viewer (roles/storage.objectViewer)**
		- storage.objects.get
		- storage.objects.list
- All four roles have these permissions:
	- resourcemanager.projects.get
	- resourcemanager.projects.list


## IAM - Most Important Concepts - A Review

![](./gcpimages/02-architecture/00-roles.png)

- **Member** : Who?
- **Roles**  : Permissions (What Actions? What Resources?)
- **Policy** : Assign Permissions to Members
	- Map Roles (What?) , Members (Who?) and Conditions (Which Resources?, When?, From Where?)
	- Remember: Permissions are NOT directly assigned to Member
		- Permissions are represented by a Role
		- Member gets permissions through Role!
- A Role can have multiple permissions
- You can assign multiple roles to a Member


## IAM policy

![](./gcpimages/00-icons/gcp/iam.png)

- Roles are assigned to users through **IAM Policy** documents
- Represented by a **policy object**
	- Policy object has list of bindings
	- A binding, binds a role to list of members
- Member type is identified by **prefix**:
	- Example: user, serviceaccount, group or domain


## IAM policy - Example

```
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "role": "roles/storage.objectAdmin",
       "members": [
         "user:you@in28minutes.com",
         "serviceAccount:myAppName@appspot.gserviceaccount.com",
         "group:administrators@in28minutes.com",
         "domain:google.com"
       ]
    },
    {
      "role": "roles/storage.objectViewer",
      "members": [
        "user:you@in28minutes.com"
      ],
      "condition": {
        "title": "Limited time access",
        "description": "Only upto Feb 2022",
        "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2022-02-01T00:00:00.000Z')",
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Playing With IAM 

![](./gcpimages/00-icons/gcp/shell.png)

- **gcloud**: Playing with IAM
	- gcloud **compute project-info** describe - Describe current project
	- gcloud **auth login** - Access the Cloud Platform with Google user credentials
	- gcloud **auth revoke** - Revoke access credentials for an account
	- gcloud **auth list** - List active accounts
	- gcloud **projects**
		- gcloud projects **add-iam-policy-binding** - Add IAM policy binding
		- gcloud projects **get-iam-policy** - Get IAM policy for a project
		- gcloud projects **remove-iam-policy-binding** - Remove IAM policy binding
		- gcloud projects **set-iam-policy** - Set the IAM policy
		- gcloud projects **delete** - Delete a project
	- gcloud **iam**
		- gcloud iam **roles describe** - Describe an IAM role
		- gcloud iam **roles create** - create an iam role(--project, --permissions, --stage)
		- gcloud iam **roles copy** - Copy IAM Roles


## Service Accounts

![](./gcpimages/00-icons/gcp/compute-instance-card.png)
![](./gcpimages/arrowtd.png)
![](./gcpimages/00-icons/gcp/storage-card.png)

- Scenario: An Application on a VM needs access to cloud storage
	- You DONT want to use personal credentials to allow access
- (RECOMMENDED) Use **Service Accounts**
	- Identified by an email address (Ex: id-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com)
	- Does NOT have password
		- Has a **private/public RSA key-pairs**
		- Can't login via browsers or cookies
- Service account types:
    - **Default service account** - Automatically created when some services are used
    	- (NOT RECOMMENDED) Has **Editor role** by default
    - **User Managed** - User created
    	- (RECOMMENDED) Provides fine grained access control
    - **Google-managed service** accounts - Created and managed by Google
    	- Used by GCP to perform operations on user's behalf
    	- In general, we DO NOT need to worry about them


## Use case 1 : VM <-> Cloud Storage
![](./gcpimages/00-icons/gcp/compute-instance-card.png)
![](./gcpimages/arrow-card.png)
![](./gcpimages/00-icons/gcp/storage-card.png)
- **1:** Create a Service Account Role with the right permissions
- **2:** Assign Service Account role to VM instance
- **Uses Google Cloud-managed keys**:
	- Key generation and use are automatically handled by IAM when we assign a service account to the instance
	- Automatically rotated
	- No need to store credentials in config files
- **Do NOT delete** service accounts used by running instances: 
	- Applications running on those instances will lose access!


## Use case 2 : On Prem <-> Cloud Storage (Long Lived)

![](./gcpimages/00-icons/gcp/user-card.png)
![](./gcpimages/arrowtd.png)
![](./gcpimages/00-icons/gcp/storage-card.png)
- You **CANNOT assign Service Account directly to an On Prem App**
- **1:** Create a **Service Account** with right permissions
- **2:** Create a **Service Account User Managed Key**
	- ***gcloud iam service-accounts keys create***
	- Download the service account key file
		- Keep it secure (It can be used to impersonate service account)!
- **3:** Make the service account key file accessible to your application
	- Set environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
		- ***export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/PATH_TO_KEY_FILE"***
- **4:** Use **Google Cloud Client Libraries**
	- Google Cloud Client Libraries use a library - Application Default Credentials (ADC)
		- ADC uses the service account key file if env var GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS exists!


## Use case 3 : On Prem <-> Google Cloud APIs (Short Lived)

![](./gcpimages/00-icons/gcp/iam.png)
- **Make calls from outside GCP to Google Cloud APIs** with short lived permissions
	- Few hours or shorter
	- **Less risk** compared to sharing service account keys!
- **Credential Types**:
	- OAuth 2.0 access tokens
	- OpenID Connect ID tokens
	- Self-signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
- **Examples**:
	- When a member needs elevated permissions, he can assume the service account role (Create OAuth 2.0 access token for service account)
	- OpenID Connect ID tokens is recommended for service to service authentications:
		- A service in GCP needs to authenticate itself to a service in other cloud

## Service Account Use case Scenarios 

| Scenario | Solution  | 
|:--|:--|
|  Application on a VM wants to talk to a Cloud Storage bucket  |  Configure the VM to use a Service Account with right permissions |
|  Application on a VM wants to put a message on a Pub Sub Topic   |  Configure the VM to use a Service Account with right permissions |
| Is Service Account an identity or a resource?| It is both. You can attach roles with Service Account (identity). You can let other members access a SA by granting them a role on the Service Account (resource).|
| VM instance with default service account in Project A needs to access Cloud Storage bucket in Project B | In project B, add the service account from Project A and assign Storage Object Viewer Permission on the bucket|

![](./gcpimages/00-icons/gcp/iam.png)

## ACL (Access Control Lists)
- **ACL**: Define **who** has access to your buckets and objects, as well as **what level** of access they have
- **How is this different from IAM?**
	- IAM permissions apply to all objects within a bucket
	- ACLs can be used to customized specific accesses to different objects
- User gets access if he is allowed by either IAM or ACL!
- (Remember) **Use IAM for common permissions** to all objects in a bucket
- (Remember) **Use ACLs** if you need to **customize access to individual objects**
