Let's get a quick overview of Server Side vs Client Side Encryption for Amazon S3 using KMS. 

## You will learn
- What is Server Side Encryption?
- What is Client Side Encryption?
- How can you implement Encryption for S3 using KMS?
- When do we use Server Side vs Client Side Encryption?


## KMS and Cloud HSM

- How do you generate, store, use and replace your keys?
- AWS provides two important services - **KMS** and **Cloud HSM**
	- Manage your keys
	- Perform encryption and decryption

## AWS KMS

- Create and manage **cryptographic keys** (symmetric and asymmetric)
- **Control their use** in your applications and AWS Services
- Define key usage permissions (including **cross account** access)
- Track key usage in AWS CloudTrail (regulations & compliance)
- **Integrates with almost all AWS services** that need data encryption
- **Automatically rotate master keys** once a year 
	- No need to re-encrypt previously encrypted data (versions of master key are maintained)
- **Schedule key deletion** to verify if the key is used
	- Mandatory minimum wait period of 7 days (max-30 days)

## Server Side Encryption

- Client sends data (as is) to AWS service
- AWS service interacts with KMS to perform encryption on the server side
- Recommended to **use HTTPS endpoints** to ensure encryption of data in transit
	- All AWS services (including S3) provides HTTPS endpoints
	- Encryption is optional with S3 but highly recommended in flight and at rest

## Server Side Encryption - S3

- **SSE-S3**: 
	- AWS S3 manages its own keys
	- Keys are rotated every month
	- Request Header - *x-amz-server-side-encryption(AES256)*
- **SSE-KMS**: 
	- Customer manages keys in KMS
	- Request Headers - *x-amz-server-side-encryption(aws:kms)* and *x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id(ARN for key in KMS)*
- **SSE-C**: 
	- Customer sends the key with every request
	- S3 performs encryption and decryption without storing the key
	- HTTPS is mandatory

## Client Side Encryption

- Client **manages encryption process** and sends encrypted data to AWS service
	- AWS will not be aware of master key or data key
- AWS service stores data as is
- For Amazon S3, you can use a client library (Amazon S3 Encryption Client)
